# Unison Lists

Lists are used in the Unison programming language to represent a finite, ordered collection of elements. They're written with comma-separated elements in square braces:

```
emptyList = []

listNats : [Nat]
listNats = [1,2,3,4]

listText : [Text]
listText = ["hello", "world"]
```

Unison implements lists as a finger tree, allowing for fast access of the first and last element. You can read more about the underlying implementation in the [standard library List documentation][list-docs]. Appending single elements to either side of the list can be done with the `+:` and `:+` operators:

```
myList = [1,2,3,4]

> 0 +: myList :+ 5
  ⧩
  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Concatenating lists is supported with the `++` operator:

```
> [1,2] ++ [3,4,5]
  ⧩
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The standard library, `base` contains a variety of functions available for `List` transformations. Check them out by using the `find.all` command in the UCM or by exploring the `List` namespace in [Unison share][list-docs].

## List pattern matching

It's common to pattern match on the head and tail elements of a list with the `+:` syntax:

```
match ["a", " b", "c"] with
  head +: tail -> head
  otherwise -> "otherwise"
```

But in Unison you can also pattern match on the last element of a list, just reverse the operator:

```
match ["a", " b", "c"] with
  prefix :+ last -> last
  otherwise -> "otherwise"
```

Multi list element matching is supported by surrounding the desired elements in square brackets, followed by the concatenation operator, `++`. This expression will match any list with a length of two or more elements:

```
match ["a", " b", "c"] with
  [first, second] ++ remainder -> first
  otherwise -> "otherwise"
```
