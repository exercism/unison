# Learning

The [official Unison language documentation](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/fundamentals/values-and-functions/terms/) is an excellent place to start learning. It details fundamental Unison concepts, like functions, data types, and algebraic effects.

We've created [a video walk-through of the workflow for running and testing an Exercism problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UMaaiJnWGY) if you're working on the command line with the Unison Codebase Manager.

For reference material, the [Unison language reference](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/language-reference/top-level-declaration/) contains granular details about Unison features. They're listed in the website sidebar.

You may want to familiarize yourself with [Unison Share](https://share.unison-lang.org/), Unison's repository for public libraries and projects. The documentation for the standard library, [`base`](https://share.unison-lang.org/@unison/code/latest/namespaces/public/base/latest), contains helpful usage information.

ðŸ‘‹ If you're ever stuck, we're happy to help. The #beginner-friendly channel in [the official Unison Discord server](https://unison-lang.org/discord) is filled with friendly people.
