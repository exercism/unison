# Instructions append

- Bonus points: can you generalize your implementation to find the majority element of any type of List? Is your implementation performant if there are many different elements to choose from when finding the majority?
- While you can implement the `majorityFinder` function in any way you choose, we've provided a few stubs which use the `Store` ability. You'll need to implement the `runWith` handler if you choose to use this ability. `runWith` returns both the result of running the function which uses the `Store` ability and the final state of the `Store`.
- You can read more about how ability handlers can track state in [the ability handler documentation][ability-handler-docs].
