# Instructions

You've been tasked with identifying if there's a color of candy in a bag that represents the majority share of bag. 🍬 The majority element is the one which takes up over half of the space in a collection. Given a list of elements representing the colors, return the color found as the majority, otherwise indicate that no majority has been found.

For a simple list, `[Red, Red, Blue, Red, Green]`, the returned value should be Red because Red occurs 3 times out of a list of 5. But for a list  `[Red, Red, Blue, Green]`, there is no majority despite Red being the most common element because 2/4 is not greater than half of the elements.
