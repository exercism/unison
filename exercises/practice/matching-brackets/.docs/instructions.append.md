# Instructions append

There are many ways to accomplish this exercise, but we've provided some additional stubs for folks who'd like to practice writing their own [ability handlers][ability-handler-docs].

The signature for the `checkBalance` helper function given for this exercise makes use of an ability requirement, `{Stack}`. The ability `Stack` is defined for you, but the handler, `Stack.run` is not! If you chose, you can implement the `Stack.run`, `checkBalance`, and `isPaired` function. The tests will run even if you choose not to implement this exercise with abilities.
