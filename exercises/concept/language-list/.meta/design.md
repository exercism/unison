# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `List` type.
- Know how list can be constructed with `[]` and `head +: tail` syntax
- Use basic functions related to Lists.
- Parts 1,2,3 (empty, add, drop1) teach basic list primitives like, `[]`, `+:`, and `drop`, or associated pattern matching conventions.
- Part 4 (size) teaches folding over the list, or tracking state via recursion and pattern matching
- Part 5 (contains) teaches the contains function or folding over the list
- Part 6 (reverse) teaches foldRight or `+:` in the context of pattern matching

## Out of scope

- `Text` functions and string manipulation
- Memory and performance characteristics.
- Polymorphism

## Concepts

- `lists`
  - know of the existence of the `List` type
  - know of the idea of `List` design
  - know some basic patterns / functions
